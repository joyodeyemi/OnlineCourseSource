# OnlineCourseSource

This is a project i thought about while taking HTML tutorial course on Codecademy.
Using the elements i learned about in the first section of the tutorial which included;

1. Basic HTML page structure
2. Adding Images
3. Reducing Image Size
4. Comments
5. Adding Links
6. Adding List
7. Adding Form
I was able to create OCS as seen in the first commit.
